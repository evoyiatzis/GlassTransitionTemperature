# GlassTransitionTemperature
Computation of the glass transition temperature using density - temperature data

The implemented method is based on the work of Patrone et al (P.N. Patrone, A. Dienstfrey, A.R. Browning, S. Tucker, S. Christensen "Uncertainty Quantification in Molecular Dynamics Studies of the Glass Transition Temperature" Polymer 87 (2016) 246-259). It assumes that a single hyberpola, as defined by Eq. (1) in Patrone et al and shown below, fits density vs temperature data for the entire temperature range.
